The Button Component is an Interactive Component that lets you execute Commands & Destroy UI when it gets pressed. It automatically adds a  `UnityEngine.UI.Image`  to the panel, allowing you to change the  `sprite`,  `material`  &  `color`  on it.

### Button as a Parent
click events bubble up, meaning that they will get triggered on every Panel until a Component consumes them. This means itâ€™s possible to use the Button as a Parent and still get notified when the Player clicks a child panel.
